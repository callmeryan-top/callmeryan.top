I like to think of it like this \u2013 you\u2019re at a bar or coffee place and want to strike up a conversation with someone. It would be a bit weird if you walked up to them, just said HELLO and then stared waiting for a reply wouldn\u2019t it? Online you even have some material to work with \u2013 you know a crazy amount about them, even what they look like with no clothes on\u2026</p>"},{"location":"hi/#some-tips-then","title":"Some tips then:","text":""},{"location":"hi/#read-their-profile","title":"Read their profile","text":"<p>Work out what mutual things you have going.

If you\u2019re just trying to attract my attention, then try that cruise button \u2013 even less effort required!</p>"},{"location":"hi/#post-pix-pls","title":"Post pix pls","text":"<p>Yes I\u2019m shallow, but don\u2019t jump to conclusions about my type; brains are sexy (see above).

There\u2019s no harm in a quick summary in your message though. Read Trikoot\u2019s guide on what not to say. Worked example:</p> <p>Hi there! I saw the picture of you in that amazing rubber suit (is it from Latex Catfish?) on twitter and I thought I\u2019d say hello, and well, you do look really cute tied up in rubber :)</p> <p>Forgive me for being upfront, but I wondered whether you might be up for playing one day? I think we have lots of mutual interests and I\u2019m sure I could entertain you in the playroom.</p> <p>Happy to chat and meet socially first of course \u2013 face pics attached. Lots more about me at puploki.com</p> <p>Disclaimer: I\u2019m not some sort of amazing dating god, so if this doesn\u2019t work for you, sorry, but this kind of thing would totally get a reply from me.</p>"},{"location":"hi/#start-again","title":"Start again?","text":"<p>So if you\u2019ve read this and want to give it another try, I\u2019ll totally reply to you.</p>"}]}
